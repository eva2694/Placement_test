This Python program defines the `load_csv_from_blob` function to load CSV data from Azure Blob storage into a pandas DataFrame. The function takes Azure Storage credentials (account name and key), container name, and blob name as parameters. It establishes a connection to Azure Blob storage using the credentials and retrieves the data from the specified blob. To work with large CSV files (more than 100 MB), the function uses pagination to read the data in fragments, converting each fragment into pandas DataFrames. These DataFrames are then combined into a single DataFrame. The main program function asks the user for Azure Storage account credentials and information about the blob, calls the `load_csv_from_blob` function to load the CSV data, and prints the first few rows of the DataFrame if the load is successful. If any errors occur, such as the blob not found, appropriate error messages are printed.
